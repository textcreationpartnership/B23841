            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THis Ship having lain in <hi>Newman</hi>'s Dock, in <hi>Lymhouſe-Hole,</hi> about a month, and her Lead-ſheathing much commended by all the unprejudic'd that have ſeen it; at which, its Enemies being as much offended, they have lately raiſed another new <hi>Objection</hi> againſt it, after all their old Stories of <hi>rubbing off by Boats and Lyters, ranging of Cables, lying on Ground, eating of Ruddar-Irons;</hi> and laſtly, <hi>of rotting the Okam in the Seams,</hi> have been fully proved from common Sence and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, upon 30 Ships, within theſe 30 years, to be falſe or frivolous, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Papers, Printed and Publiſhed by Mr. <hi>Hale,</hi> from time to time, as they gave him occaſion, which they ought as publickly to have anſwer'd, if he had not fairly prov'd the ſame, and doubtleſs they had, if they could have ſaid any thing that would bear a publick Teſt: But they ſtill run on with new Stories, as falſe or frivolous as the old ones; not conſidering how ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous it is, after ſo much Time and Experience upon ſo many Ships, ſo diligently watched for faults by them, to pretend now to new diſcoveries of defects, never heard of before, as he has heard of late; they ſay, the Barnicles or Shells (as ſome there muſt be, tho' in no proportion for ſize or quantity, as upon a Wood-ſheathing) have eaten quite into the Lead, and cannot be got off, and that therefore this Sheathing won't do: But what ground for this report and concluſion, he cannot imagine; for if they had ſeen it before it was cleaned, as was intended, and thought the Shells never ſo hard to come off, they ſhould not have been ſo poſitive (that diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers too much ill will to it) that it could not be done, ſince Scrapers in a very little time, for 15 <hi>s.</hi> pay, have cleaned the whole Ship, to content as well as at firſt; which, if any pleaſe to view by <hi>Tueſday</hi> next (when ſhe goes out of the Dock) he doubts not but they will receive full ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in this point, as in all others, of the excellency of this Lead-ſheath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in preference to the beſt Wood-ſheathing hitherto uſed.</p>
